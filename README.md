# Substructure detection challenge

![](index.png)
_Examples rendered with HST resolution, PSF, and noise. Ticks are 2 arcsec_

* 10 systems with substructure drawn from different mass functions.
* Files contain the lensed source emission only, no PSF and no noise, units are W m^-2 arcsec^-2
* Pixel scale is 0.01 arcsec
